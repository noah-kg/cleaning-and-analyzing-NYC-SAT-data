# Cleaning & Analyzing New York City SAT Results

Begin a teacher in South Korea helped me get a new perspective on the education system in America. In particular, I was wondering how things like ethnicity, gender, neighborhood, etc. have an effect on a school's SAT scores.

In this project I showcase the following:

* Data aggregation
* Multiple cleaning techniques
* Combing multiple datasets into a single data frame
* Exploratory data analysis
* Aesthetic data visualizations
